    "## Data Description\n",
    "The observations are the Asian-Americans surveyed in Austin, Texas. The attributes are a range of quality of life measurements. This dataset will help us understand the rapid growth rate and unique challenges as a new immigrant group calls for a better understanding of the social and health needs of the Asian American population. This dataset was funded by the City of Austin’s Public Information Office. Researchers and participants guided the observation of data. During the study, participants elevated their responses by adding “respect and appreciation of diverse cultures and acknowledgement of the legacy of the Asian community in Austin. The kind of data that was recorded focused on the project's goal to improve the city of Austin’s Asian American resources on health, housing,  culture, civic engagement, and economic development. The data came to formation through a three-year community engagement process. Commissioners, consultants and City staff worked with partner agencies and individual volunteers to meet Asian American community members where they live, work and play. More than 3,350 individuals took one of two surveys during the initiative either online or in-person at a variety of locations throughout the city, “Conversation Over Tea,” and other City of Austin hosted meetings to facilitate dialogue and share anecdotes about their lives. Additionally, “travel booths” were present at various events throughout the city engaging hundreds of Asian Americans. Participation included almost every ZIP code within the city and adjacent areas. The people involved were aware of the data collection. They were surprised to learn that the data was to be used for the City of Austin to hear about their dreams, challenges and contributions. A raw source to the data can be found [here](https://data.austintexas.gov/City-Government/Final-Report-of-the-Asian-American-Quality-of-Life/hc5t-p62z), under Export > CSV configurations.\n",

    "## Data Limitations\n",
    "Limited amount of quantitative data values will make it difficult to generate traditional-looking scatter plots. Questions asked to participants had responses of different scales. Data collected is limited to representing the attitudes of Asian-Americans living in Texas. Certain ethnic groups dominate over others which may lead to skewed results when extrapolating quality of life measurements. Some response variables will be affected by confounding variables such as different cultural aspects among sub-ethnic groups. (e.g. some ethnic groups have leaner diets which would impact conclusions drawn.)\n",
