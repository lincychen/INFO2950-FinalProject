    "We are going to perform a multi-linear regression where the outcome variable is quality of life. The predictor variables include 'income','retired', 'regular_exercise', 'healthy_diet', 'cancer','heart_disease', 'physical_checkup', 'close_friends','discrimination','household_size', 'education_completed','english_difficuties', and 'english_speaking'. This adresses our research question \"How do health, finances, community support (or the lack thereof), and identities affect an Texan Asian American's quality of life?\" because it analyzes the relationship between quality of life and all of the features that we believe would determine one's quality of life. We expect the $r^2$ value to be at least 0.5 because we believe that these are determinant of whether a person has a higher quality of life. \n",

    "For our second analysis, we will use a logistic regression to try to predict the quality of life of hypothetical people based on income, retired, english_speaking, regular_exercise, healthy_diet, close_friends, education_completed, physical_checkup, discrimination, ethnicity, and religion. We chose these categories by looking at the correlation heatmap and comparing between each of the variables to quality of life; we included the variables that showed a decent corrleation. We expect the result to be fairly accurate at predicting one's quality of life."
