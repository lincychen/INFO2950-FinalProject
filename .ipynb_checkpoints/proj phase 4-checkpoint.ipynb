    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Upon seeing the rise in Asian hate crimes this past year, our group was curious to find the contributing factors to the rise in these crimes. As we scoured the internet for information, however, the topic of the well-being of Asian Americans in the US piqued our interest. More specifically, we wanted to focus on the quality of life of Asian Americans. We were able to access a dataset by data.austintexas.gov, that included information on the health, finances, community support, and identity of Asian Americans in Texas. This source, titled “Final Report of the Asian American Quality of Life” inspired our research question: How can we define Asian-American communities in Texas in terms of health, happiness, and financial security? and How do health, finances, community support (or the lack thereof), and identities affect a Texan Asian American's quality of life?” Through our research, we found that there is strong evidence that supports specific factors like income, English fluency, and retirement as having a direct effect on the quality of life of Texan Asian Americans.

    "## DATA DESCRIPTION\n",
    "In terms of the data, the observations consist of the participants, and the attributes include ones listed as:\n",
    "income', 'retired', 'us_born', 'english_speaking', 'english_difficulties', 'ethnicity','age', 'regular_exercise', 'healthy_diet', 'heart_disease', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'cancer', 'health_insurance', 'physical_check-up', 'quality_of_life', 'religion', 'gender', 'close_friends', 'discrimination_', 'duration_of_residency', 'household_size', 'education_completed’\n",
    "This dataset was created so as to get specific data on factors like ethnicity, income, health, and community. The purpose is to get a better sense of Asian Americans who reside in Texas, and how their quality of life is. The creation of this dataset was funded by the local Austin government, with the data collection being done by local volunteers at city-wide events throughout the span of three years. Some processes that might’ve influenced what data was observed and recorded could have been the documentation process. From the dataset, there were some spots for certain participants that were empty, which could’ve been affected by the way the data was collected (ie: participants weren’t required to fill everything out, or participants weren’t monitored). There wasn’t much preprocessing that was done for the data aside from putting the results in the sheets. The participants who were involved with the data collection were aware of the data being collected and knew that the purpose of the data collection was to better understand the wellbeing of Asian Americans in Austin, Texas. The raw source can be found here.\n"

    "## Data Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited amount of quantitative data values will make it difficult to generate traditional-looking scatterplots and visualize possible relationships between variables. We foresee a barriers in conducting assessments that predict based off of existing trends due to this. When addressing demographics, the lack of records for previous years will be an obstacle when making comparisons on whether factors measuring the quality of life of Asian-Americans progressed or regressed. One real-world impact that can be derived from this limitation is that Asian-Americans will be less able to identify existing quality-of-life indicators, and  practices that the city of Austin should continue or cease based off patterns in the data. This will restrict the level of specificity in insights concerning emerging patterns we see. Data collected is also limited to representing the attitudes of Asian-Americans living in Texas. Their environment, for example, may be different from the attitudes of Asian-Americans in more or less urban areas, and cannot encapsulate the attitudes of all Asian-Americans. The meaning of the results in this case, would be less useful in terms of its applicability as we do not have randomly-sampled results of all Asian-Americans. This datasets' quality of record-keeping also faltered in areas where respondents were able to leave answers blank. This consequently resulted in NaNs, impacting the meaning of the results  \n",
    "\n",
    "Certain ethnic groups dominate over others which may lead to skewed results when extrapolating quality of life measurements in mentioning the atittudes of Asian-American populations. For example, out of all the ethnic groups described, Protestant Asian-Americans reported experiencing the highest amount of discrimination. However, it would be innaccurate to assume that Protestantism is a motivating factor for racists to engage in discriminatory behaviors towards Asian-Americans. Some response variables will be affected by confounding variables such as different cultural aspects among sub-ethnic groups. (e.g. some ethnic groups have leaner diets which would impact conclusions drawn when studying Asian-American health). In this case, the higher rates of discrimination can also be explained in how the data shows Korean-Americans are primarily of Protestant faith. Given that they were also the ethnicity group to report the highest amounts of discrimination, this shows how the data can only go so far to explain why certain qualities might cause others. "

    "We are going to perform a multi-linear regression where the outcome variable is quality of life. The predictor variables include 'income','retired', 'regular_exercise', 'healthy_diet', 'cancer','heart_disease', 'physical_checkup', 'close_friends','discrimination','household_size', 'education_completed','english_difficuties', and 'english_speaking'. This adresses our research question \"How do health, finances, community support (or the lack thereof), and identities affect an Texan Asian American's quality of life?\" because it analyzes the relationship between quality of life and all of the features that we believe would determine one's quality of life. We expect the $r^2$ value to be at least 0.5 because we believe that these are determinant of whether a person has a higher quality of life. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our second analysis, we will use a logistic regression to try to predict the quality of life of hypothetical people based on income, retired, english_speaking, regular_exercise, healthy_diet, close_friends, education_completed, physical_checkup, discrimination, ethnicity, and religion. We chose these categories by looking at the correlation heatmap and comparing between each of the variables to quality of life; we included the variables that showed a decent corrleation. We expect the result to be fairly accurate at predicting one's quality of life."
