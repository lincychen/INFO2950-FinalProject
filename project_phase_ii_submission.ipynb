    "## Data Description\n",
    "Within this study, the participants—located in Austin—started by responding to the survey questions asked with respect and appreciation of diverse cultures and acknowledgement of the legacy of the Asian community. More specifically, the data that was collected and recorded was centered around the primary objective of improving Asian American resources for the local Austin community. These resources included topics that covers health, housing, culture, civic engagement, and economic development. The process of acquiring this data set spanned across a three-year community engagement process, on which commissioners, consultants, and city staff partnered with agencies and volunteers to meet with the Asian Americans in the community. For the survey, more than 3,350 individuals took either one of the surveys either online or in person throughout the city. This occurred at “Conversation Over Tea” and the other City of Austin. These locations, in addition to travel booths,  were used to facilitate dialogue and anecdotes from their lives. The participants covered are from every ZIP code within Austin and it’s neighboring areas. In terms of ethical concerns, the participants were aware that they’re data was being collected and shared for the purpose of better understanding their experiences as an Asian American. A raw source to the data can be found [here](https://data.austintexas.gov/City-Government/Final-Report-of-the-Asian-American-Quality-of-Life/hc5t-p62z), under Export > CSV configurations.\n",

    "## Data Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited amount of quantitative data values will make it difficult to generate traditional-looking scatterplots and visualize possible relationships between variables. We foresee a barriers in conducting assessments that predict based off of existing trends due to this. When addressing demographics, the lack of records for previous years will be an obstacle when making comparisons on whether factors measuring the quality of life of Asian-Americans progressed or regressed. One real-world impact that can be derived from this limitation is that Asian-Americans will be less able to identify existing quality-of-life indicators, and  practices that the city of Austin should continue or cease based off patterns in the data. This will restrict the level of specificity in insights concerning emerging patterns we see. Data collected is also limited to representing the attitudes of Asian-Americans living in Texas. Their environment, for example, may be different from the attitudes of Asian-Americans in more or less urban areas, and cannot encapsulate the attitudes of all Asian-Americans. The meaning of the results in this case, would be less useful in terms of its applicability as we do not have randomly-sampled results of all Asian-Americans. This datasets' quality of record-keeping also faltered in areas where respondents were able to leave answers blank. This consequently resulted in NaNs, impacting the meaning of the results  \n",
    "\n",
    "Certain ethnic groups dominate over others which may lead to skewed results when extrapolating quality of life measurements in mentioning the atittudes of Asian-American populations. For example, out of all the ethnic groups described, Protestant Asian-Americans reported experiencing the highest amount of discrimination. However, it would be innaccurate to assume that Protestantism is a motivating factor for racists to engage in discriminatory behaviors towards Asian-Americans. Some response variables will be affected by confounding variables such as different cultural aspects among sub-ethnic groups. (e.g. some ethnic groups have leaner diets which would impact conclusions drawn when studying Asian-American health). In this case, the higher rates of discrimination can also be explained in how the data shows Korean-Americans are primarily of Protestant faith. Given that they were also the ethnicity group to report the highest amounts of discrimination, this shows how the data can only go so far to explain why certain qualities might cause others. \n",
